# Student Management System (Java)

## Overview
This is a **menu-driven Java program** that demonstrates the concepts of **classes, array of objects, instance members, and constructors** in Java. It allows users to **add, display, search, update, and delete students** using an `ArrayList`. 

## Features Implemented
- **Encapsulation:** The `Student` class uses private attributes with getter and setter methods.
- **Array of Objects:** Uses `ArrayList<Student>` to store student records dynamically.
- **Instance Members & Constructors:** Each student is created using a constructor with attributes like PRN, name, DoB, and marks.
- **Modular Structure:** Separate methods handle different operations for better readability and maintainability.
- **Menu-driven Interface:** Allows users to interact and perform operations easily.

## Files in the Repository
### 1. `Student.java`
Defines the **Student class** with the following attributes:

| `Student(String prn, String name, String dob, double marks)` | Constructor to initialize student details. |
| `getPrn()`, `setPrn(String prn)` | Getter and setter for PRN. |
| `getName()`, `setName(String name)` | Getter and setter for Name. |
| `getDob()`, `setDob(String dob)` | Getter and setter for Date of Birth. |
| `getMarks()`, `setMarks(double marks)` | Getter and setter for Marks. |
| `displayStudent()` | Displays student details. |
